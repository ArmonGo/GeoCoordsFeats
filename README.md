This repository contains the implementation for the models included in the experimental comparison as presented in:

Coordinates Are Just Features: Rethinking Spatial Dependence in Geospatial Modeling

## Data set 

All the datasets used in this paper are currently available in kaggle. Five datasets come from R package Spatstat.data.

More implementation details please check the file 'dataloader.py' and 'dataload.R'.




## Implementation 
The implementation details are in folder 'Code_git'.

the tuned hyperparameters is shown in the file 'run.py'.

## Result
You can find the result in the original paper [waiting for a link]
